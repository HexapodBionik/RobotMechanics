# RobotMechanics
A repository for the Mechanics Team of the project. It includes robot 3D models, simulations and documentation of mechanical components.

## Repo Usage
### Folder Structure
- 3d Models
  - Materials
	- Drawing templates
	- Parts and Subassemblies
		- Assembly specific
			- [Example] Front Right Leg (Here there is no project version because components are shared between assembly versions)
				- 3D Printed
					- "Link A - v0 2024 09 11 - elongated"
					- Link B Parts
					- "Link B - v2 2024 01 12  - assembled"

### File Name structure 
**Project** - "project name - v**x**". - A big thing to do (e.g. Changing the structure of a leg with new parts and different dimensions). If there is already a leg "v0" then the next leg will be called "v1". Projects do not have to be related to modeling. For example a project can be a calculation of centers of gravity of segments

**Assemblies, Subassemblies Parts etc** - "Name (part number if bought) - version number Year month day - notes if any". 
- For example
	- "Link A - v0 2024 09 11 - elongated".
	- "Servo 130kg (abc36A51) - v1 2025 11 09 - weight accurate to model bought "
